                I am passionate about cloud automation, incident management, and monitoring to improve systems reliability.
                Cloud automation for me isn't just a task to implement into our production environment, but rather a goal
                to eliminate human error and produce results at a higher rate while maintaining accuracy. I have utilized cloud
                automation in monitoring, as I found in this area that this was of the utmost importance. Monitoring effectively
                with the right tools allows for quick response times and an accurate understanding of what is happening in an
                incident. Also having dashboards and alerts automatically created for new resources introduced into an environment helps significantly
                decrease the manual work and time consumed by employees, but it also allows the business to make better cost analyses on their resources
                by seeing their utilization. My goal is to provide a business visibility into their systems, as one can only fix if they
                know what to fix.
